**Solutions Introduction**   
**What is your solution and how does it work? Discuss main features clearly.** 

Our solution is an **AI Co-pilot Platform for Relationship Managers (RMs)**. It works as a dedicated web and mobile application that integrates deeply with the bank's core systems (CRM, Core Banking, Dashboards) to act as a smart assistant.

It is built on two primary, powerful features:

**Feature 1: Set up the customized tone [Draft\_Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1li2zsT2uZ4A7BlroFUJMOHcKqu2UGz_GxuT9og5L9D4/edit?tab=t.0) \>\> Tính Cá nhân hóa (The Personalization Feature)**

**\[Linh điền i\]**

**Feature 2: The Proactive Notification & Action Agent** This feature is built on the workflow: *(Lấy thông tin KH trong CRM \-\> Push noti \+ chủ động draft Email/ Zalo message \-\> Send Email trực tiếp)*.

* **How it works:** The platform constantly monitors the bank's CRM and core banking data for critical, time-sensitive client events.  
* **Triggers:** This includes birthdays, loan maturity dates, certificate of deposit (CD) expiry, or "inactive" clients who haven't been contacted in 90 days.  
* **Action:**  
  1. When a trigger occurs, the RM receives an immediate **push notification** on their phone or desktop.  
  2. **Clicking the notification opens the app, the app opens with the list of customers ranking from the top priority to the last by AI**  
  3. Clicking on each customer, there has already prepared a **proactively drafted message** (Email or Zalo/WhatsApp suggestion).  
  4. This draft is personalized using the RM's pre-set tone and the client's context.  
  5. The RM can review, edit, and with one click, **"Send Email"** from the platform. For chat apps like Zalo, it provides a "copy-to-clipboard" function to paste into the app, ensuring compliance and RM control.

**Feature 3: The Interactive AI Agent (AI Co-pilot)** This is an interactive, chat-based agent inside the app where the RM can use natural language to get strategic advice, query data, and perform administrative tasks instantly. This feature has several key use cases:

* **P1: Strategic Prioritization**  
  * **Input:** The RM provides a client pool (e.g., "my entire portfolio" or "my Diamond-tier clients"); Banking document  
  * **Question:** The RM asks, "Recommend which customers I should focus on this week for cross-selling investment products."  
  * **Output:** The AI Agent analyzes the data and returns a **prioritized Top 3 list of clients**, with a brief explanation for each (e.g., "Client A: Large cash deposit just arrived. Client B: High-risk tolerance profile with no current investments.").  
* **P2: Next Best Action (Nurture)**  
  * **Input:** The RM selects a single customer; Banking document  
  * **Question:** The RM asks, "What is the best next action for this customer?"  
  * **Output:** The AI analyzes the *entire interaction history* and client profile, then suggests a specific, **necessary next action** (e.g., "Your last call was 3 months ago. Their loan matures in 60 days. **Action:** Call this week to begin renewal discussions and offer a top-up rate.").  
* **P3: Instant Performance Reporting**  
  * **Input:** The RM asks a question about their own performance, pulling data from integrated dashboards; Banking document  
  * **Question:** "How many client calls did I log last week?" or "What is the total value of my maturing deposits this month?"  
  * **Output:** The AI instantly **retrieves the specific data or dashboard** and presents the answer, saving the RM from having to navigate complex reporting tools.  
* **P4: Painless CRM Data Entry**  
  * **Input:** The RM types or dictates a simple text update after a meeting.  
  * **Example:** "Update CRM for Nguyen Van Hung: Met today, he is very interested in a 2-bedroom apartment loan. Follow up next Friday."  
  * **Output:** The AI parses this text, finds the correct client, and **automatically updates the CRM**, creating the meeting log and the new follow-up task.

**Feature 3.1: Set up the customized tone [Draft\_Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1li2zsT2uZ4A7BlroFUJMOHcKqu2UGz_GxuT9og5L9D4/edit?tab=t.0) \>\> Tính Cá nhân hóa (The Personalization Feature)**

* **Set up policy, documents**

**Impact of Solution**   
How does your solution benefit the society / the target audience?    
**For the Relationship Manager (Target Audience):**

* **Drastically Reduces Admin Time:** Feature 1 automates the "remembering" and "drafting" process. Feature 2 (P4) turns 10 minutes of manual CRM data entry into a 10-second chat command.  
* **Makes Them "Smarter" & More Strategic:** Instead of guessing, the RM is now data-driven. Feature 2 (P1 & P2) provides clear, AI-powered priorities and "Next Best Actions," allowing the RM to focus on high-value clients and opportunities.  
* **Increases Performance & Revenue:** By ensuring no opportunity is missed (Feature 1\) and by focusing efforts intelligently (Feature 2), the RM will close more deals, improve client retention, and directly increase their own performance bonuses.

**For the Bank (The Customer):**

* **Solves CRM Adoption:** The single biggest problem with CRMs is that RMs hate using them. Feature 2 (P4) solves this by making data entry effortless. This finally provides the bank with the clean, accurate data it has always wanted.  
* **Maximizes Portfolio Revenue:** Feature 1 ensures no maturing loan or deposit "leaks" to a competitor. Feature 2 (P1) ensures RMs are actively working on the bank's most profitable opportunities.

**For the End-Client (Society):**

* **A Proactive, Personalized Experience:** The client receives timely, relevant communication. Their RM remembers their birthday, knows when their loan is maturing, and suggests products that actually fit their needs (Feature 2, P2) instead of generic sales pitches. This builds trust and makes the client feel valued.

Why is your solution a good solution? How is it better than existing solutions in the market / competitors?

Our solution is better because it is an **active, intelligent co-pilot**, whereas existing solutions (like traditional **Salesforce** or **Microsoft Dynamics**) are **passive, "dumb" databases.**

* **Competitors are Reactive, We are Proactive:** A traditional CRM is a "system of record" that just stores data. It waits for the RM to log in, search for information, and remember to follow up. Our **Feature 1 (Proactive Notifications)** *actively pushes* time-sensitive opportunities to the RM, transforming the workflow from reactive to proactive.  
* **Competitors are "Forms," We are a "Conversation":** To use a competitor's tool, you must navigate complex forms and dashboards. To use our tool, you just have a conversation. Our **Feature 2 (AI Agent)** allows RMs to log notes (P4) and get strategic advice (P1, P2) in plain English. This is infinitely faster and more intuitive, which is why it will actually be adopted.  
* **Competitors Show Data, We Provide Answers:** A traditional dashboard (like in Feature 2, P3) shows you *what* happened. Our AI Agent tells you *what to do next* (P1, P2). We bridge the critical gap between data and action.

While our **next-generation feature** will be a fully "Contextual AI Overlay" that reads the screen, our *current* platform is already superior because it focuses on solving the two biggest problems for an RM: **missing opportunities** and **hating admin work.**

What is your solution’s competitive advantage / unique selling point? 

Our Unique Selling Point (USP) is the **"Dual-Function AI Engine"** that makes the RM both **efficient** and **effective**.

No other solution on the market successfully combines these two workflows:

1. **Proactive "Push" Intelligence (Efficiency):** Our platform *pushes* event-driven opportunities (birthdays, maturing loans) and pre-drafted messages *to* the RM, ensuring no opportunity is ever missed.  
2. **Interactive "Pull" Intelligence (Effectiveness):** Our platform allows the RM to *pull* on-demand strategic advice ("Who to focus on," "Next best action") and log CRM updates using simple, natural language.

While competitors sell a passive database that creates *more* administrative work, we provide an active co-pilot that *eliminates* it and makes the RM a smarter, data-driven advisor.

**Deep Dive into Solution**   
Detailed write up of solution, **e.g. level 2 data flow diagram**. Include any supporting features if necessary. 

**Architecture of Solution** 

There are two types of system that need for integration

The overall architecture for the solution:

**A. Prebuilt system**

1\) Core banking backend, that stores information of customers, RMs, managers, transaction history, …

**B. The architecture need for the Proactive Notification & Action Agent**

**C. The architecture need for the copilot**

**![][image1]**

1\) The MCP server to integrate with the backend to take, process, and transform data, making it ready for agent consumption.

2\) The core agent client, and interface to interact with user (RMs)

**![][image2]**

**D. The architecture for the customization phase, training LLMs and continuously refine it**

As in the system, we send the request to the external system, this exposes the risk of leaking user data to external systems. Also the cost will accumulate as the amount of API requests increase.

This raises the need for a self-hosted model with fully managed resources. This will lower the cost of calling. To fully manage the services of AWS, here is our proposed architecture.

1\. Data Lake: All the past data is stored here 

1. **Training (AWS Sagemaker)**  
2. **Hosting (AWS Sagemaker)**  
3. **Updating models \- LLMOps (AWS Sagemaker)**

**How does your solution make use of AWS infrastructure?** Do not just give a description of the services you are using, but explain how you are using the services in your solution. 

How are you integrating and combining the different AWS services to make your solution seamless? Include **architecture diagrams**.
